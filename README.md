Module 14: Belly Button Challenge


In this assignment I used the D3 library to read in belly buttons bacterias sample data from a group of individuals in a study. I created a series of charts that helps visualize the differences in the bacteria present in each of these individuals in addition to their washing habits.

What I created includes:

- A dropdown menu to select which individual we would like information for.
- A box with their demographic metadata information.
- A bar chart with the top 10 bacterias present by their quantity.
- A bubble chart with all the bacteria present and bubble size reflecting their relative quantity.
- A gauge chart that reflects the number of belly button washes per week based on the individual selected.
